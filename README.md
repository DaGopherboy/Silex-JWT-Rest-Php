## Getting Started
There are only three basic requirements at the moment to utilize this Demo project.  The first is git ([https://git-scm.com/](https://git-scm.com/)),
the second is composer ([https://getcomposer.org](https://getcomposer.org)), and the third is PHPUnit ([https://phpunit.de](https://phpunit.de)).
With these three tools the project is relatively easy to get going and exercise.  The commands listed below have been
tested on Windows, Linux, and OS X terminals.

### Step One - Get the source

```
  $ git clone https://github.com/DaGopherboy/Silex-JWT-Rest-Php.git
```

### Step two - Get into the same directory as the source code

```
  $ cd Silex-JWT-Rest-Php
```

### Step three - Update all of the dependencies

```
  $ composer update
```

### Step four - Run the tests

```
  $ phpunit
```


## Why do this?  There are so many other options!

Good question, there are many great frameworks out there that have authentication modules that can make bootstrapping
a new api a snap.  What I wanted to do was have a very minimalist bootstrap project that I can pull off the shelf and
start writing code to prototype something.  In addition to that goal, this project has provided a fantastic learning 
opportunity of how to use JSON Web Tokens ([http://jwt.io](http://jwt.io)); And how they can play a part in a security 
strategy for REST APIs.
